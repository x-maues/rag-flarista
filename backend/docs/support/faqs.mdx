import SetEvmVersionRemix from "/static/img/set-evm-version-remix.png";

### Why am I getting `invalid opcode: opcode 0x5f not defined`?

Flare supports EVM versions up to London, which does not support the `PUSH0` opcode, leading to this error. To fix this:

- **Using Remix:** Set EVM version to `london` in the **Advanced Configurations** section of the **Solidity Compiler** tab:

  <img src={SetEvmVersionRemix} style={{ width: 300 }} />

- **Using Hardhat or Foundry:** Set EVM version to `london` in [hardhat.config.ts](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-hardhat-starter/blob/master/hardhat.config.ts#L34) or [foundry.toml](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-foundry-starter/blob/master/foundry.toml).

- **Using Standard Solidity JSON:** Set `evmVersion` to `london`:

  ```json
  {
    "settings": {
      "optimizer": {
        /* ... */
      },
      "evmVersion": "london"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Using `solc` CLI:** Set `--evm-version` to `london`:

  ```bash
  solc --evm-version london <args>
  ```

### Where can I get Flare testnet tokens?

You can get:

- Testnet C2FLR from the [Coston2 Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston2).

- Testnet CFLR from the [Coston Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston).

To understand the difference between Coston and Coston2, see the [Network Configuration](/network/overview#configuration) page.
