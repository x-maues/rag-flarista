Transactions on different blockchains have various success statuses.
Some blockchains may include transactions even if they failed to execute as intended.

| Status             | Code |
| ------------------ | ---- |
| `SUCCESS`          | 0    |
| `SENDER_FAILURE`   | 1    |
| `RECEIVER_FAILURE` | 2    |

**Bitcoin and Dogecoin**

It is not possible to include an unsuccessful transaction in a Bitcoin or Dogecoin block.
Hence, if a transaction is included on a confirmed block, its status is "SUCCESS."

**XRPL**

On XRPL, some transactions that failed (based on the reason for failure) can be included in a confirmed block.

- **`tesSUCCESS`**: Transaction successful.
- **`tec`-class codes**: Indicate reasons for failure, such as:
  - `tecDST_TAG_NEEDED`: Missing required destination tag.
  - `tecNO_DST`: Nonexistent or unfunded destination address.
  - `tecNO_PERMISSION`: Source address lacks permission to send funds.
