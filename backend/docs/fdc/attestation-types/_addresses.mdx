### Bitcoin

An address on Bitcoin is derived from the locking script (`pkscript`).
Only standard locking scripts get assigned an address.
There are two formats of the Bitcoin addresses, `Base58` and `Bech32(m)`.
The format is determined based on the type of locking script.

#### `Base58`

Bitcoin's **Base58** format uses the following encoding dictionary:

```
123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

##### Address Structure

Decoded addresses have the format:

```
<leadingByte><hash><checksum>
```

##### Components

- **`leadingByte`**:
  - On **mainnet**:
    - `00` for Pay-to-PubKey (p2pk) and Pay-to-PubKey-Hash (p2pkh)
    - `05` for Pay-to-Script-Hash (p2sh)
  - On **testnet**:
    - `6f` for p2pk and p2pkh
    - `c4` for p2sh
- **`hash`**: Represents either the public key, hash of the public key, or hash of a script.
- **`checksum`**: The first four bytes of the double SHA-256 hash of `<leadingByte><hash>`.

##### Validation Criteria

1. Address contains only characters from the Base58 dictionary.
2. Decoded hexadecimal form is exactly **25 bytes** long (address length varies between **26 to 34 characters**).
3. Starts with a valid `leadingByte`.
4. The checksum is valid and matches the first four bytes of the double SHA-256 hash.

#### `Bech32(m)`

Bech32 is a newer address format using the character set:

```
qpzry9x8gf2tvdw0s3jn54khce6mua7l
```

##### Address Structure

A Bech32 address has the following components:

- **Human-Readable Part (HRP)**:
  - `bc` for **mainnet**
  - `tb` for **testnet**
- **Separator**: Always `1`
- **Data Part**:
  - The first character indicates the **witness version** (0-16).
  - The last six characters form a **checksum**.

The checksum differs based on the witness version:

- **Bech32** for witness version `0` ([BIP-0173](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0173))
- **Bech32m** for witness versions `1` to `16` ([BIP-0350](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0350))

##### Validation Criteria

1. Address contains only characters from the Bech32 dictionary.
2. All non-numeric characters must be either entirely uppercase or lowercase.
3. Starts with a valid HRP followed by the separator (`1`).
4. Length is between **14 to 74 characters**, with the length modulo 8 being **0, 3, or 5**.
   - For witness version `0`, length must be **42 or 62 characters**.
5. Checksum is validated based on the witness version.
6. Addresses with witness versions `2` and above are unsupported and invalid.

### Dogecoin (`Base58`)

Dogecoin uses a **Base58** dictionary, identical to Bitcoin's:

```
123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

#### Address Structure

Decoded addresses have the format:

```
<leadingByte><hash><checksum>
```

#### Components

- **`leadingByte`**:
  - On **mainnet**:
    - `1e` for p2pk and p2pkh
    - `16` for p2sh
  - On **testnet**:
    - `6f` for p2pk and p2pkh
    - `71` for p2sh
- **`hash`**: Represents either the public key, hash of the public key, or script hash.
- **`checksum`**: First four bytes of the double SHA-256 hash of `<leadingByte><hash>`.

#### Validation Criteria

1. Address contains only characters from the Base58 dictionary.
2. Length is **26 to 34 characters**. Decoded hex form is **25 bytes**.
3. Valid leading byte:
   - **Mainnet**: Starts with `D`, `A`, or `9`.
   - **Testnet**: Starts with `n`, `m`, or `2`.
4. The checksum is validated.

### XRPL (`Base58`)

The XRP Ledger uses a custom **Base58** dictionary:

```
rpshnaf39wBUDNEGHJKLM4PQRST7VWXYZ2bcdeCg65jkm8oFqi1tuvAxyz
```

#### Address Structure

Decoded to hexadecimal:

```
<leadingByte><publicKeyHash><checksum>
```

#### Components

- **`leadingByte`**:
  - On **mainnet**: `00` (addresses start with `r`).
- **`publicKeyHash`**: A **20-byte** hash of the public key.
- **`checksum`**: The first four bytes of the double SHA-256 hash of `<leadingByte><publicKeyHash>`.

#### Validation Criteria

1. Address contains only characters from the XRPL Base58 dictionary.
2. Length is **25 to 35 characters**. Decoded hex form is **25 bytes**.
3. Address starts with `r`.
4. The checksum is valid.
