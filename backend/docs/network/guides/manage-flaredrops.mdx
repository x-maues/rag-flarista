[FlareDrops](https://flare.network/flaredrop-guide/) are a series of 36 monthly drops totalling 24.2 billion FLR can be claimed by active Flare community members who have wrapped their Flare tokens.
This guide explains how to manage FlareDrop functionality in applications.

<summary>**Understanding Personal Delegation Accounts (PDAs).**</summary>

Differences between PDAs and regular accounts:

- A PDA cannot have another PDA of its own.
- PDA addresses cannot participate in governance directly, but their owners can transfer all their votes to another address (their main account or someone else's).
- A PDA automatically converts any FLR tokens transferred to it to wrapped Flare tokens (WFLR), which are more useful for functions such as delegation.
- Only the owner of the main account can transfer funds from the PDA and only to the main account.
- When an executor is configured, it will claim rewards both from the main account and the PDA, and send them to the PDA.

<summary>**Understanding the Registered Claim Process.**</summary>

Registration allows accounts to list themselves onchain as registered executors and post their service fees. This simplifies the process for both users and executors: users can easily find a suitable executor, and executors benefit from automatic fee transfers when user rewards are claimed. Users pay a fee to set an executor for claiming their rewards, which are then claimed automatically without user intervention. All agreements with a registered executor occur onchain.

Here is how the registered claiming process works, with applications performing these actions on behalf of executors and users:

1. Executors who want to be publicly available to users register as executors by paying a registration fee, which is then burned.
2. Registered executors post their fees for claiming rewards.
3. Users with accrued rewards who want an executor to claim on their behalf can choose from the list of registered executors.
4. Users pay a setup fee to enable a registered executor to claim their rewards, and this fee is sent to the executor.
5. Executors claim rewards for one or more users, with their fees automatically deducted from the claimed rewards.
6. Executors notify users offchain if they discontinue providing this service.

Throughout the process:

- Users and executors can view reports on which addresses executors are claiming for and which executors are registered.
- Registered executors can change their fees or unregister, while users can change the registered executor claiming on their behalf or disable automatic claiming.

## Contracts

Working with the FlareDrop requires interacting with these contracts:

- `DistributionToDelegators` ([address](/network/solidity-reference), [interface](/network/solidity-reference/IDistributionToDelegators)): Manages FlareDrop claims.
- `ClaimSetupManager` ([address](/network/solidity-reference), [interface](/network/solidity-reference/IClaimSetupManager)): Automating reward claiming.

## Basic Claiming

The [`claim`](/network/solidity-reference/IDistributionToDelegators#claim) method on `DistributionToDelegators` allows claiming the FlareDrop one account at a time.
It transfers the FlareDrop rewards accrued by account `_rewardOwner` during the specified `_month` to the specified `_recipient`. `_wrap` controls whether the reward is transferred in native FLR tokens or wrapped in WFLR tokens.
You can use [`getCurrentMonth()`](/network/solidity-reference/IDistributionToDelegators#getcurrentmonth) to find out the current month (starting at 0), or [`getClaimableMonths()`](/network/solidity-reference/IDistributionToDelegators#getclaimablemonths) to get the interval of months which are currently available for claiming.

```solidity
function claim(
    address _rewardOwner,
    address _recipient,
    uint256 _month,
    bool _wrap
) external returns(
    uint256 _rewardAmount
);
```

:::note

Use [`getClaimableAmount()`](/network/solidity-reference/IDistributionToDelegators#getclaimableamount) or [`getClaimableAmountOf()`](/network/solidity-reference/IDistributionToDelegators#getclaimableamountof) to find out if a given address has pending rewards on any given month.

:::

The `claim()` function returns the amount of claimed rewards. Two modes of operation are supported:

- **Self-Claiming**: When `msg.sender` matches `_rewardOwner`

  Here, the caller is claiming its own rewards, and the `_recipient` can be any address.

- **Claiming on behalf of another account**: When `msg.sender` does not match `_rewardOwner`

  Here, the caller must be a claim executor, claiming on behalf of `_rewardOwner`. If `_msg.sender` is not in the authorized list of executors for `_rewardOwner`, the call will revert.
  Authorized executors must be set beforehand by `_rewardOwner` using [`setClaimExecutors()`](/network/solidity-reference/IClaimSetupManager#setclaimexecutors).
  The `_recipient` must either be `_rewardOwner`, its PDA, or any of the authorized recipients previously set by `_rewardOwner` using the [`setAllowedClaimRecipients()`](/network/solidity-reference/IClaimSetupManager#setallowedclaimrecipients) on `ClaimSetupManager`.
  The call will revert otherwise.

## Batched Claiming

The [`autoClaim()`](/network/solidity-reference/IDistributionToDelegators#autoclaim) method allows claiming the FlareDrop for an arbitrary amount of accounts in a single call, with convenient default values.
It claims the rewards accrued by all the accounts in the `_rewardOwners` array during the specified `_month`.
If an account does not have an enabled PDA, the rewards are sent to the same account.
However, if an account does have an enabled PDA, the rewards are sent to the PDA account.
Any rewards accrued by the PDA account are also claimed and sent to the PDA.
Rewards claimed with this method are always wrapped.

```solidity
function autoClaim(
    address[] calldata _rewardOwners,
    uint256 _month
) external;
```

If the executor is a registered executor with a nonzero fee, the fee is automatically deducted from each claimed reward and sent to the executor account (unwrapped).
If rewards are claimed for both an address and its PDA, the fee is deducted only once.

The call reverts if:

- `msg.sender` is not in the authorized list of executors for any of the `_rewardOwners`.
- The total claimed rewards for any of the `_rewardOwners` is not high enough to cover the executor's fee.
