Staking works by locking funds for a period of time to support a specific network validator. The guide details out how to stake using the [flare-stake-tool](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-stake-tool) CLI.

<details>
<summary>Understand staking on Flare.</summary>

When validator owners stake to their own nodes they **self-bond**, whereas all other participants are said to **delegate** their stake to that validator.
Note that delegating your stake to a validator is different from FTSO delegation.

Participants choose how much to stake and for how long their stake will be locked.
The minimum values are:

|                  | Self-bond | Delegation |
| ---------------- | --------: | ---------: |
| Minimum amount   |    1M FLR |    50K FLR |
| Minimum duration |   60 days |    14 days |

At the end of every reward epoch (i.e. 3.5 days on Flare Mainnet), participants are rewarded according to how well their chosen validator performed in that period.

**Limits**

The amount that you can stake and the rewards you can gain by staking are restricted by these limits:

- **Delegation factor**: Limits the total amount that can be staked to a validator to its self-bond, which is the amount validators stake to their own nodes, times the delegation factor, which is 15.
  For example, if a validator has a self-bond stake of 1M FLR, the total sum of all stakes, including delegations, cannot exceed 15M FLR.
  This limit allows for 14M FLR of delegations.

- **Staking cap**: Limits the reward performance of individual validators to **5% of the total staked amount**.
  If you stake your funds on a validator with more than 5% of the total staked amount, you receive less FLR in reward.
  To maximize your reward, delegate your staking funds to a validator with less than 5% of the total staked amount of FLR.

- **Maximum number of validators**: You can stake to any number of validators, but rewards, FlareDrops, and governance vote power only apply for up to 3 different validators.

Given that the Flare network uses two independent underlying chains, there is one extra step that must be considered.
Funds must be transferred from the C-chain, where smart contracts run, to the P-chain, where staking happens.
After the staking period expires and funds are unlocked, they can be transferred back to the C-chain.

## Prerequisites

Install the following tools:

- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Setup

1. Install the `flare-stake-tool` CLI:

   ```bash
   npm install @flarenetwork/flare-stake-tool -g
   ```

2. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool
   ```

   The tool's banner is displayed:

   ```text
   _____ _                  ____  _        _           ____ _     ___
   |  ___| | __ _ _ __ ___  / ___|| |_ __ _| | _____   / ___| |   |_ _|
   | |_  | |/ _` | '__/ _ \ \___ \| __/ _` | |/ / _ \ | |   | |    | |
   |  _| | | (_| | | |  __/  ___) | || (_| |   <  __/ | |___| |___ | |
   |_|   |_|\__,_|_|  \___| |____/ \__\__,_|_|\_\___|  \____|_____|___|

   Version: 3.0.2
   ```

3. You can specify the account from which staking will take place in different ways. Choose one of the following two options:

<details>
<summary> Ledger setup (recommended). </summary>

**Install the Avalanche Application**

1. **Connect & Unlock:**

   - Connect your Ledger device to your computer.
   - Unlock it using your PIN code.

2. **Open Ledger Live:**

   - Launch the [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) application.
   - Navigate to the **My Ledger** tab and ensure your device firmware is up-to-date.

3. **Install Avalanche App:**
   - In the **App Catalog** tab, search for **Avalanche**.
   - Click **Install**.

**Note:** The Avalanche app requires 138 KB of space on a **Ledger Nano S**. You may need to remove other apps if space is insufficient.

**Select Your Desired Account**

1. **Close Conflicting Applications:**

   - Exit Ledger Live.
   - Ensure the device is not connected to other applications like MetaMask.

2. **Open the Avalanche App:**

   - On the device, open the Avalanche app. The screen should display **"Avalanche Ready"**.

3. **Start the Staking Tool:**

   - Open a terminal and run:

     ```bash
     flare-stake-tool interactive
     ```

   - This starts the staking tool in interactive mode.

4. **Connect Your Wallet:**

   - After the welcome banner, the tool asks how to connect your wallet:

     ```text
     ? How do you want to connect your wallet? (Use arrow keys)
     > Ledger
     Public Key
     Private Key (not recommended)
     ```

   - Select **Ledger** and press **Enter**.

5. **Choose Network:**

   - Next, choose the desired network:

     ```text
     ? Which network do you want to connect to? (Use arrow keys)
     > Flare (Mainnet)
     Coston2 (Testnet)
     LocalHost (for development only)
     ```

   - Select **Flare (Mainnet)** and press **Enter**.

   - A **"Fetching Addresses..."** message appears briefly.

6. **Select an Address:**

   - A list of addresses linked to the Ledger device is displayed.
   - Select the desired address and press **Enter**.

**Important:** Ensure this address has a positive `$FLR` balance for transaction fees and staking. Funds can be transferred later if needed.

7. **Access the Main Menu:**

   - The main menu appears:

     ```text
     ? What do you want to do? (Use arrow keys)
         View chain addresses
     >   Check on-chain balance
         Get network info
         Get validator info
         Move assets from C-chain to P-chain
         Move assets from P-chain to C-chain
         Add a validator node
     ```

   - As an example, select **Check on-chain balance** and press **Enter**.

   - The tool displays the C-chain and P-chain balances before exiting.

**Account Persistence:** - After completing the setup, a `ctx.json` file is created in the current folder. - This file stores the selected account details, allowing you to skip the setup process on subsequent uses from the same folder.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Private key setup (not recommended).</summary>

If you **do not have a Ledger device**, you can still use your private key for staking. However, this method is **significantly less secure** and should be used only when no other option is available. Proceed with caution and ensure maximum file security.

**Create a Secure Text File**

1. **Create a Text File:**

   - Create a text file in a **secure folder** accessible only to you.
   - Use any file name you prefer.

2. **Add Your Private Key:**

   - Open the file and insert one of the following lines based on your private key format:

     ```text
     PRIVATE_KEY_CB58=""
     PRIVATE_KEY_HEX=""
     ```

   - **CB58 Format:** Use this if your key is in [CB58](https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4587395-what-is-cb58) format.
   - **HEX Format:** Use this if your key contains 64 hexadecimal characters.

   - **Important:** Paste your private key **inside the quotes** and save the file.

**Verify Private Key Access**

1. **Launch the Staking Tool:**

   - Open a terminal and run the following command:

     ```bash
     flare-stake-tool interactive
     ```

   - This starts the staking tool in interactive mode, prompting you with configuration questions.

**Connect Your Wallet**

1. **Select Connection Type:**

   - After the welcome banner, the following prompt appears:

     ```text
     ? How do you want to connect your wallet? (Use arrow keys)
         Ledger
         Public Key
     >   Private Key (not recommended)
     ```

   - Select **Private Key** using the arrow keys and press **Enter**.

2. **Enter File Path:**

   - You'll see a security warning:

     ```text
     Warning: You are connecting using your private key which is not recommended
     ? Enter Path to Private Key file (E.g. /home/wallet/pvtKeyFile):
     ```

   - Enter the full file path where your private key file is stored and press **Enter**.

**Choose Network**

- The following prompt appears:

  ```text
  ? Which network do you want to connect to? (Use arrow keys)
  > Flare (Mainnet)
      Coston2 (Testnet)
      LocalHost (for development only)
  ```

- Select **Flare (Mainnet)** and press **Enter**.

**Access the Main Menu**

- The main menu appears:

  ```text
  ? What do you want to do? (Use arrow keys)
      View chain addresses
  >   Check on-chain balance
      Get network info
      Get validator info
      Move assets from C-chain to P-chain
      Move assets from P-chain to C-chain
      Add a validator node
  ```

- As an example, select **Check on-chain balance** and press **Enter**.

- The tool will display your account balance for both the **C-chain** and **P-chain**, then exit.

**Security Reminder:**

- Using a private key stored in a plain text file is inherently **insecure**.
- Consider switching to a **Ledger device** or another secure method whenever possible.
- **Never share your private key** or expose it to untrusted applications.

</details>

4. Note down the **node ID** of the validator you want to stake to:

   - If you created the validator, retrieve its node ID by running:

     ```bash
     curl --location 'http://localhost:9650/ext/info' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"info.getNodeID" }'
     ```

   - If you want to stake to somebody else's validator, get a JSON list of all validators by running:

     ```bash
     flare-stake-tool info validators
     ```

5. Note down the desired staking **start time** and **end time**: When staking to an existing validator, both these times must be inside the period when the validator is active. If you specify a period when the validator is inactive, your transaction on the P-chain reverts.
   To find the period when the validator is active:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool info validators
   ```

## Move funds to P-chain

1. Check your C-chain and P-chain balances by selecting the **Check on-chain balance** option when executing:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool interactive
   ```

   Your currently available funds on the C-chain and P-chain are shown in the last lines. Funds currently staked are locked and are not reflected in the P-chain balance.
   They will become automatically available when the staking period expires.

   ```plaintext
   ? How do you want to connect your wallet? Ledger
   You already have an existing Ctx file with the following parameters -
   Public Key: ●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●
   Network: flare
   Eth Address: 0x●●●●●●●●
   ? Do you wish to continue with this? yes
   ? What do you want to do? Check on-chain balance
   Using network: flare
   Balances on the network "flare"
   // highlight-next-line
   C-chain 0x●●●●●●●●: 100000.0 FLR
   // highlight-next-line
   P-chain P-flare●●●●●●●●: 50000.0 FLR
   ```

   If you already have funds on the P-chain, skip the next step.

2. Select the **Move assets from C-chain to P-chain** option when executing:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool interactive
   ```

   You are asked the amount of FLR you want to transfer:

   ```plaintext
   ? What do you want to do? Move assets from C-chain to P-chain
   ? Enter amount (in FLR): 50000
   ```

   :::warning[Transaction Fees]

   When transferring from the C-chain to the P-chain, transaction fees are wholly paid from the C-chain.
   Make sure you leave enough funds on the C-chain after the transfer, or it will fail.

   :::

3. Transfers between chains are made of two operations: an **export** from the C-chain followed by an **import** to the P-chain. Therefore, you are asked to confirm two transactions.

   ```plaintext
   // highlight-next-line
   Please approve export transaction
   Using network: flare
   Fetching account from ledger...
   Creating export transaction...
   Using fee of 0.00028075 FLR
   Please review and sign the transaction on your ledger device...
   Sending transaction to the node...
   Transaction with id ●●●●●●●● sent to the node
   // highlight-next-line
   Please approve import transaction
   Using network: flare
   Fetching account from ledger...
   Creating export transaction...
   Please review and sign the transaction on your ledger device...
   Sending transaction to the node...
   Transaction with id ●●●●●●●● sent to the node
   Finished execution
   ```

If you encounter any issues during this process, refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## Stake

1. After you have funds on the P-chain, execute the following command and select the appropriate option:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool interactive
   ```

   - If you are going to delegate to your own node (self-bonding), select **Add a validator node**.

   - If you are going to stake to another node (delegation), select **Delegate to a validator node** (You may need to scroll down to see this option).

   :::info[First-time address registration.]

   The first time you use the **Add a validator node** or **Delegate to a validator node** options you are asked to sign an additional transaction. This step is required so that staking rewards accrued on the P-chain can be claimed on the C-chain and participate in the wider ecosystem. This procedure only needs to be done once per P-chain address and it progresses like this:

   ```plaintext
   Checking Address Registration...
   No address found for key 0x●●●●●●●●
   Note: You need to register your wallet address before you can delegate your funds
   // highlight-next-line
   Please complete this registration transaction to proceed
   Submitting txn to the chain
   ```

   :::

2. You then need to provide the following information:

   - **amount**: Amount must be provided in FLR units.
   - **node ID**, **start time** and **end time**: Use the values noted down from the [setup](#setup).

3. If you selected **Add a validator node**, you have to set the **delegation fee**. This is the percentage of all rewards that the node owner keeps.
   The rest is split proportionally between the self-bond and all delegators that contributed stake. 10 means 10%, so the maximum value is 100.

   ```plaintext
   ? What do you want to do? Add a validator node
   ? Enter amount (in FLR): 50000
   ? Enter Node NodeId (E.g. NodeID-FQKTLuZHEsjCxPeFTFgsojsucmdyNDsz1): NodeID-●●●●●●●●
   ? Enter start time(E.g. 1693185095): ●●●●●●●●
   ? Enter end time(E.g. 1693185095): ●●●●●●●●
   ? Enter delegation fee(E.g. 10): 10
   ```

4. You are then asked to confirm the staking transaction on your hardware wallet.

   ```plaintext
   Using network: flare
   Fetching account from ledger...
   Creating export transaction...
   // highlight-next-line
   Please review and sign the transaction on your ledger device...
   Sending transaction to the node...
   Transaction with id ●●●●●●●● sent to the node
   Finished execution
   ```

   Your stake is now locked and will start accruing rewards after the configured start time arrives.
   When the end time arrives, the funds will be automatically unlocked.

If you encounter any issues during this process, refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## Check Stake

1. You can now double-check that the operation has been properly registered by looking at the current list of validators:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool info validators > validators.txt
   ```

   This creates a file called `validators.txt`. Open it and search for the line containing the **P-chain address** of your account. If you don't remember your address run:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool info addresses
   ```

2. If your account has stake on any node, you will find a section similar to:

   ```json
   {
     "txID": "28Yf5yQ3xt9yaMvfZ1RP5jkCkT4y2pfD86UheZUHFVng2tFcWd",
     "startTime": "1688569201",
     "endTime": "1696345201",
     "stakeAmount": "16750000000000000",
     "nodeID": "NodeID-C6i8mruq11VdxGQ7tiUBgrRqoLBot86df",
     "rewardOwner": {
       "locktime": "0",
       "threshold": "1",
       "addresses": [
         // highlight-next-line
         "P-flare19c8zfml39x6efnw5j90nl85dmwdqhluwhrxz9g"
       ]
     },
   },
   ```

   Check that the `stakeAmount` (in wei), `nodeID`, `startTime`, and `endTime` match the values you configured. If you have multiple active stakes, your address will show up multiple times.

## Move funds back to C-Chain

1. Finally, you also have the option to move your P-chain funds back to the C-chain where they can participate in the wider ecosystem. You can only transfer P-chain funds that are not currently locked in any stake. Select the **Move assets from P-chain to C-chain** option when executing:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool interactive
   ```

2. You are asked the amount of FLR you want to transfer:

   ```plaintext
   ? What do you want to do? Move assets from P-chain to C-chain
   ? Enter amount (in FLR): 50000
   ```

   :::warning[Transaction Fees]

   When transferring from the P to the C-chain, transaction fees are paid from BOTH chains.
   Make sure you leave enough funds on both chains after the transfer, or it will fail.

   :::

3. Again, the transfer between the two chains require you to confirm two transactions.

   ```plaintext
   // highlight-next-line
   Please approve export transaction
   Using network: flare
   Fetching account from ledger...
   Creating export transaction...
   Please review and sign the transaction on your ledger device...
   Sending transaction to the node...
   Transaction with id ●●●●●●●● sent to the node
   // highlight-next-line
   Please approve import transaction
   Using network: flare
   Fetching account from ledger...
   Creating export transaction...
   Using fee of 0.00028075 FLR
   Please review and sign the transaction on your ledger device...
   Sending transaction to the node...
   Transaction with id ●●●●●●●● sent to the node
   Finished execution
   ```

If you encounter any problem, see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## Claiming rewards

At the end of every reward epoch, participants are rewarded according to how well their chosen validator performed in that period, but these rewards are not claimable yet. Every 4 reward epochs, rewards are accumulated in a dedicated smart contract and can then be claimed from the Flare Stake CLI tool:

1. Select the **Claim Rewards** option when executing:

   ```bash
   flare-stake-tool interactive
   ```

   You are shown the amount of pending rewards (in wei) and are asked how much you want to claim (in FLR):

   ```plaintext
   ? What do you want to do? Claim Rewards
   Checking your Rewards status...
   You have unclaimed rewards worth 1000000000000000000
   ? Enter amount to claim (in FLR): 1
   ```

2. Select **Receive with another wallet** and enter the C-chain address where you want the rewards to be sent.
   This can be the same address from where you are staking.

   ```plaintext
   ? Where do you want to receive your rewards? Receive with another wallet
   ? Please enter the C-address where you want to receive your rewards: 0x●●●●●●●●
   ```

   You are then asked to confirm the staking transaction on your hardware wallet.

   ```text hl_lines="1"
   Please sign the transaction on your ledger
   Submitting txn to the chain
   Rewards successfully claimed
   Finished execution
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot connect to Ledger device, No Device, Cannot retrieve addresses, or similar**

  Make sure:

  - The device is connected, the Avalanche app is opened, and it shows the "Avalanche Ready" message.
  - No other application like Ledger Live or MetaMask is connected to the device.
  - The device is not in stand-by mode.
  - You are not running on Windows from a Linux terminal (WSL). Use a native Windows console instead.

- **Insufficient funds**

  Make sure enough funds will remain after a transaction to pay for the transaction fees. If too much time has elapsed between the transaction's creation and its confirmation on the Ledger, the calculated fee might be incorrect.
  Try the operation again. The network might be congested and the calculated fees might not be high enough. Try the operation again after a while.

- **Import transaction failed and the funds have vanished**

  Transfer operations require [an export and an import transaction](#move-funds-to-p-chain).
  If the export succeeds, but then the import fails, it looks like the funds have disappeared from both chains, but they are still retrievable.

  Repeat the failed import operation manually:

  - If you are moving funds from the C-chain to the P-chain:

    ```bash
    flare-stake-tool transaction importCP --ledger --blind
    ```

  - If you are moving funds from the P-chain to the C-chain:

    ```bash
    flare-stake-tool transaction importPC --ledger --blind
    ```

- **Unsupported digital routines**

  If you get the following error message:

  ```text
  E: Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
  ```

  Make sure you are using the correct Node.js version, as advised in the [Prerequisites section](#prerequisites).

  You can find out the version of Node.js you are running with the following command:

  ```bash
  node --version
  ```

- **Manual registration using the block explorer**

  - Retrieve the public key that generated the accounts you want to use.
    From a terminal, run `flare-stake-tool info addresses` and copy the long hexadecimal string starting with `0x` in the last line.

    ```plaintext
    Using network: flare
    Addresses on the network "flare"
    P-chain address: P-flare●●●●●●●●
    C-chain address hex: 0x●●●●●●●●
    // highlight-next-line
    secp256k1 public key: 0x●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●
    ```

  - You need to interact with the `AddressBinder` smart contract, so you must retrieve its address from the `FlareContractRegistry`.
  - Enter the address of the `AddressBinder` contract in the block explorer, and go to the **Write Contract** tab.
  - Click on **Connect Wallet**. You do not need to use the same account as the one you are binding.
  - Locate the `registerPublicKey` method and paste the public key from step 1 into the `_publicKey` field.
  - Click on **Write** and confirm the transaction from your wallet.

  If the transaction is successful, your account's P-chain and C-chain addresses are now bound.

- **Manual Reward Claiming**

  Rewards can also be claimed directly from the `ValidatorRewardManager` contract that accumulates them:

  - You need to interact with the `ValidatorRewardManager` smart contract, so you must retrieve its address from the `FlareContractRegistry`.
  - Enter the address of the `ValidatorRewardManager` contract in the block explorer, and go to the **Write Contract** tab.
  - Click on **Connect Wallet**.
    You need to connect the account for which you are claiming.
  - Locate the `claim` method and enter the following information:

    - `_rewardOwner`: C-chain address that accrued the rewards.
    - `_recipient`: Address where the rewards must be sent.
    - `_rewardAmount`: Amount to claim. Find the pending amount using the `getStateOfRewards` method in the **Read Contract** tab.
    - `_wrap`: Whether the rewards should be also wrapped, as a convenience.

  - Click on **Write** and confirm the transaction from your wallet.

  If the transaction is successful, the reward is transferred to the specified recipient.
