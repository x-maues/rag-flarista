This guide is for developers who want to interact with Flare using Rust. In this guide, using Rust, you will learn how to:

- Query a contract on Flare using [alloy-rs](https://github.com/alloy-rs), an async library for interacting with Ethereum-like chains.
- Compile a Solidity contract using the CLI interface of [solc](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity), the Solidity compiler.
- Deploy your compiled contract on Flare.

:::tip

All examples in this guide are available at [developer-hub/examples](https://github.com/flare-foundation/developer-hub/tree/main/examples).

:::

## Getting started

Install the Solidity compiler by following the instructions in the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#linux-packages). The main commands are provided here:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS via Homebrew" default>

    ```bash
    brew tap ethereum/ethereum
    brew install solidity
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu via PPAs">
  
    ```bash 
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install solc
    ```
    
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Install the following dependencies:

```bash
cargo add alloy eyre tokio --features alloy/full,tokio/rt,tokio/rt-multi-thread,tokio/macros
```

### Usage

You need to connect to testnet or mainnet via an RPC, any RPC listed on the [Network Configuration](/network/overview#configuration) page will work. For this guide, you can use the Public RPC.

<Tabs groupId="network">
  <TabItem value="coston2" label="Flare Testnet Coston2" default>

    <CodeBlock language="rust" title="src/bin/chain_id.rs">
      {ChainIdCoston2}
    </CodeBlock>

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="flare" label="Flare Mainnet">

    <CodeBlock language="rust" title="src/bin/chain_id.rs">
      {ChainIdFlare}
    </CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```bash
cargo run --bin chain_id
```

## Querying a contract

To query a contract, two pieces of information are required:

- Contract address
- Contract ABI (Application Binary Interface)

For this example, you can use the `FlareContractRegistry` contract which has the same address `0xaD67FE66660Fb8dFE9d6b1b4240d8650e30F6019` across both testnet and mainnet.

### Fetch ABI

To fetch a contract's ABI, copy the [FlareContractRegistry ABI](https://api.routescan.io/v2/network/testnet/evm/114/etherscan/api?module=contract&action=getabi&address=0xaD67FE66660Fb8dFE9d6b1b4240d8650e30F6019&format=raw), and paste it into a file named `FlareContractRegistry.json`, located in the root of your project, i.e. same level as `Cargo.toml`.

### Make query

You can now query the `FlareContractRegistry` contract to get the addresses of other Flare contracts.

For example, querying it for the address of the `WNat` contract:

<Tabs groupId="network">
  <TabItem value="coston2" label="Flare Testnet Coston2" default>

    <CodeBlock language="rust" title="src/bin/make_query.rs">
      {MakeQueryCoston2}
    </CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="flare" label="Flare Mainnet">

    <CodeBlock language="rust" title="src/bin/make_query.rs">
      {MakeQueryFlare}
    </CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```bash
cargo run --bin make_query
```

## Compiling a contract

For this example, you can use the `FtsoV2FeedConsumer` contract to query the FTSOv2 feeds. Copy the `FtsoV2FeedConsumer` sample contract code given below, and save the `.sol` file in the same folder as your `Cargo.toml`.

<details>
<summary>`FtsoV2FeedConsumer` sample contract</summary>

Note that the contract interface dependencies have been inlined to avoid any import issues.

<CodeBlock language="solidity" title="FtsoV2FeedConsumer.sol">
  {FtsoV2FeedConsumerNoImports}
</CodeBlock>

</details>

### Compile with solc

To compile the contract using the Solidity CLI compiler, create a file named `config.json`:

<CodeBlock language="json" title="config.json">
  {Config}
</CodeBlock>

```bash
solc --standard-json config.json  > FtsoV2FeedConsumer.json
```

This will generate a `FtsoV2FeedConsumer.json` file with the contract's ABI and bytecode.

### Modify format

Things get a bit annoying here, as the alloy-rs `solc!()` macro expects a specific format for the JSON, which is not the same as the output from the Solidity compiler. To fix this, in the generated `FtsoV2FeedConsumer.json`, remove the top-level JSON fields, after you are done, the JSON should look like:

```json title="FtsoV2FeedConsumer.json"
{
  "abi": [
    ...
  ],
  "evm": {
    ...
  }
  "metadata": "..."
}
```

## Create account

Before deploying a contract, you need to have an account with some testnet or mainnet gas tokens. You can create a new Flare account using `create_account.rs`:

<CodeBlock language="rust" title="src/bin/create_account.rs">
  {CreateAccount}
</CodeBlock>

```bash
cargo run --bin create_account
```

This will output a new private key and an account pair.

:::danger

- Never share your private keys.
- Never put your private keys in source code.
- Never commit private keys to a Git repository.

:::

You can save the account and private key into environment variables `ACCOUNT` and `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` respectively.

:::note

You can also import the raw hex private key to MetaMask and any other wallet - the private key can be shared between your Rust code and any number of wallets.

:::

- For testnet, you can get free testnet C2FLR on the [Coston2 Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston2).
- For mainnet you will need to fund the account with FLR. You can buy FLR with regular currency in places like centralized exchanges, crypto on-ramps, or swap other tokens for FLR on decentralized exchanges.

## Deploying with alloy-rs

With the account ready, you can now deploy the contract. In a `deploy_contract.rs` file, you can define the following code to deploy the contract:

<Tabs groupId="network">
  <TabItem value="coston2" label="Flare Testnet Coston2" default>

    <CodeBlock language="rust" title="src/bin/deploy_contract.rs">
      {DeployContractCoston2}
    </CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="flare" label="Flare Mainnet">

    <CodeBlock language="rust" title="src/bin/deploy_contract.rs">
      {DeployContractFlare}
    </CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can now run the `deploy_contract.rs` script to deploy the contract. The contract address will be printed once the deployment is successful. You can check the contract address on a Flare Blockchain explorer, linked on the [Network Configuration](/network/overview#configuration) page.

```bash
cargo run --bin deploy_contract
```

Congratulations! You have now successfully deployed a contract on Flare using ðŸ¦€.
