The **Flare Systems Protocol** encompasses the following core system protocols:

1. **P-chain Stake Voting Protocol**
2. **Signing Policy Definition Protocol**
3. **Validator Uptime Voting Protocol**
4. **Reward Voting Protocol**
5. **Random Number Generation Protocol** (dependent on the FTSOv2 Scaling)

Protocols with voting frequencies tied to reward epochs are implemented directly on the [`FlareSystemsManager`](/network/fsp/solidity-reference/IFlareSystemsManager) smart contract, while others operate as sub-protocols. Each sub-protocol has a unique protocol ID, except for the system protocols mentioned above.

## P-chain Stake Voting Protocol

- **Protocol ID**: 1
- **Voting Frequency**: Per voting epoch
- **Description**: Functions similarly to sub-protocols, using the Flare Systems Client to submit signatures for Merkle tree-based protocol messages. It captures stake and delegation records from the P-chain during each voting epoch.
- **Finalization**: Occurs on the Relay contract.
- **Incentives**: Rewards for timely signing and finalization come from inflation. However, mirroring weights to delegators is not incentivized.

**Infrastructure**: Utilizes a Flare P-chain indexer, requiring a specially configured observation node.

## Signing Policy Definition Protocol

- **Voting Frequency**: Per reward epoch
- **Description**: Ensures that voter weights for the next reward epoch are locked and signed by a threshold weight of current voters. This information is relayed to other EVM chains, enabling cross-chain message relaying.

  **Phases**:

  - **Random Number Acquisition**: Triggered 2 hours before the end of the reward epoch. The random number is fetched via the FTSO scaling protocol.
  - **Vote Power Block Selection**: Occurs after random number acquisition to select a block for vote power.
  - **Voter Registration**: Lasts 30 minutes, allowing self-registration based on the selected block’s weights.
  - **Signing Policy Snapshot**: Snapshots voter addresses, weights, and thresholds for the next reward epoch.
  - **Signing Policy Sign Phase**: Ends when the threshold of signatures is reached. Delays beyond 20 minutes incur penalties.

- **Finalization**: Via the `signNewSigningPolicy` function.
- **Incentives**: No direct rewards; instead, delays incur penalties by burning fee claims based on the extent of delay.

**Infrastructure**: Utilizes the Flare indexer.

## Validator Uptime Voting Protocol

- **Voting Frequency**: Per reward epoch
- **Description**: After each reward epoch, voters submit signed lists of validator NodeIDs with sufficient uptime (≥80%). Voting concludes when a threshold weight (e.g., 60%) is reached.
- **Finalization**: Through the `signUptimeVote` function.
- **Incentives**: Collective penalization for delays by blocking reward claims.

**Infrastructure**: Requires a connection to a local node, reusing the Flare P-chain indexer infrastructure.

## Reward Voting Protocol

- **Voting Frequency**: Per reward epoch
- **Description**: After each reward epoch, and once uptime voting is complete, voters aggregate reward claims across sub-protocols into a Merkle tree. A final Merkle root is voted on, enabling the `RewardManager` contract to verify and pay out rewards.

  **Process**:

  - Sub-protocols submit reward claims based on participation data.
  - The aggregated claims form a Merkle tree, with voting to confirm the root.

- **Finalization**: Via the `signRewards` function.
- **Incentives**: No special rewards; delays penalize all voters by blocking reward distribution.

**Infrastructure**: Uses sub-protocol-specific scripts and data from the Flare indexer.

## Random Number Generation Protocol

- **Description**: Random numbers are generated by the [FTSOv2 Scaling](/ftso/scaling/overview). These are used for masking commits and are calculated from reveals during the scaling process. The random number forms part of a Merkle tree, confirmed via the Relay contract.

## Additional Non-System Sub-Protocols

- **Protocol ID 14**: [FTSOv2 Scaling](/ftso/scaling/overview)
- **Protocol IDs 20+**: [FDC](/fdc/overview) Instances
  - Multiple instances allow scaling, lower finalization thresholds, and segregation based on maturity and security considerations.
