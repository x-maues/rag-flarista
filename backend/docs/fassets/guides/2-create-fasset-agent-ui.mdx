The FAssets Agent user interface (UI) is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users managing the FAssets agent. It allows users to monitor the agent bot and create and manage FAssets agent vaults.

You can access the FAssets Agent UI after you follow the guide how to [set up the FAssets agent](/fassets/guides/deploy-fassets-agent).

Once you have saved the information and initiated the process, please allow some time for the Flare Data Connector (FDC) to verify the details and create the vault. This can take up to five minutes. You can monitor the status of the vault creation in the Agent Bots list.
